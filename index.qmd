# Detailed Instructions Coming later this semester!

## What is Project B?

Project B is the second of two real data science projects you'll be doing this semester. It involves the completion of four tasks, which you’ll start working on in early November:

1. You will complete a Proposal to obtain my approval for your plan, let me know if you’re working with a partner, and schedule your oral presentation.
2. You (and your partner, if applicable) will present your project sometime between 12-11 and 12-15 to Dr. Love in his office in person or via Zoom.
3. You will build Quarto and HTML reports describing your work.
4. Finally, you will complete a Self-Evaluation form.

We strongly encourage you not to worry about Project B until you’ve completed Project A.
